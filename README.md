# Registration Parsing

The initial script deployed when evaluating registration results for most of Chandra's meetings. A more thorough script than AbstractParser.py

Every time the script is run, various fields and lists on associated webpages are updated, registrants from various science groups are tallied, abstracts are sorted and written to a timestamped file, lists of "badge names" are updated, registrant demographics are generated, and private meeting statistic pages are updated.
